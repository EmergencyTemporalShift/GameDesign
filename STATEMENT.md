# Game Design Team Statement

(Mostly TODO)

As a team, our main motivation is to set forth the project's vision of getting people involved on Open Source Software as first-time contributors, which is one way to achieve the project's main objective of fostering Computer Science education.

## Goals

- Design immersive, addictive and fun mechanics for HE1 and HE2.
- Balance the mechanics in order to create fairness and competitiveness.
- Design compelling stories for HE1 and HE2.
- Provide a simple and efficient way to handle players' feedback and suggestions.

## Plan

Note: We are still figuring this out. Do send suggestions if you've got any.
